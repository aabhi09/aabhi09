# 👋 Hey, I'm Aabhinav(Aabhi)

I’m a **Marketing and Technology student** with a growing interest in how digital tools, data, and software can be used to improve everyday systems and decision-making. I enjoy understanding not just how things work, but why they work, especially at the intersection of business strategy and technology.

My learning approach is very hands-on. Instead of only relying on theory, I prefer building small applications and projects that allow me to apply concepts in real time. This helps me better understand problem-solving, logical thinking, and how real-world digital products are developed from scratch.

Over time, I’ve developed a strong curiosity for **automation, APIs, and data-driven systems**, particularly how they can support productivity, user experience, and smarter business outcomes. I’m constantly exploring ways to write cleaner code and structure programs in a more organised and scalable manner.

### 🚀 What I’m currently working on

At present, I’m focused on strengthening my technical foundation through practical projects that challenge both my logic and creativity.

One of my main projects is a **Weather Forecasting Application**, built using Python and real-time APIs. Through this project, I’ve been learning how data is fetched, processed, and displayed, as well as how to handle errors and improve reliability.

Alongside this, I’ve developed a **Todo List Application** that focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and clean logic. This project has helped me understand how even small applications require thoughtful structure and user-focused design.

Beyond individual projects, I’m actively working on improving my **backend logic, folder organisation, and overall project architecture**, ensuring my code becomes more readable, maintainable, and professional over time.

### 🧠 Skills, tools, and learning focus

Through my academic journey and self-driven learning, I’ve gained experience with a range of tools and concepts that support both technical and analytical work.

I primarily work with **Python**, using it for scripting, logic development, and small-scale applications. I also have experience working with **APIs**, understanding how external data sources integrate into applications.

Version control and documentation are important parts of my workflow, which is why I regularly use **GitHub** to manage projects, track improvements, and maintain clean repositories. I rely heavily on **VS Code** as my main development environment, using it for debugging, testing, and improving workflow efficiency.

I also have exposure to **basic data visualisation**, allowing information to be presented in a clear and understandable format — an important skill when connecting technical insights with marketing or business decisions.

### 🌱 Continuous growth mindset

I strongly believe that learning in technology is a continuous process. Every project I work on teaches me something new — whether it’s improving logic, fixing errors, or understanding better ways to structure applications.

My goal is not just to write working code, but to build solutions that are logical, clean, and meaningful. I’m constantly refining my skills, learning from mistakes, and looking for opportunities to grow both technically and professionally.
